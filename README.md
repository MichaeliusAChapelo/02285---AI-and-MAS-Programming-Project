We solve box problems.

Remember we are measured in 1) Optimal solution length and 2) Total computation time.
That also means memory/space reductions is less a priority.

Strategies (feel free to add):
* Only save states of significance (i.e. checkpoints), skip intermediate steps. Saves mostly only memory.
